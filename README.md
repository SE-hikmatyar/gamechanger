ShiftSmart is a platform that connects clients directly with skilled professionals like Home Builders, Engineers, and Architects, eliminating intermediaries. It allows users to browse professional profiles, search based on expertise and location, and directly interact via a built-in chatbot. Users can also leave reviews, helping others find the best professionals.

The application uses Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and integrates Google Maps for location sharing. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with possible React.js integration).
